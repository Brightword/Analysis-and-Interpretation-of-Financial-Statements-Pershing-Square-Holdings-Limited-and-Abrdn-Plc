# Financial Statements Analysis and Interpretation (Pershing Square Holdings Limited and Abrdn Plc)

## Table of Contents


### Project Overview
There are many uses and users of company’s financial statements. Majority of the users lack understanding of the financial statements as contained in the company’s annual report. Hence, negative outcomes such as poor decision-making, ineffective financial planning, increased fraud, limited access to capital, regulatory compliance issues and stock market crises are worsened. Companies dress up their financial reports to only highlight what they want the public to see.  So, a mere look at the audited financial report of any company is inadequate for accurate business decision making. For example, there are reportedly approximately $620 billion of mark-to-market losses on banks’ security portfolios that are not currently reflected on bank’s financial statements.
This project aims to; 
1.	analyse and critique the financial statements of Pershing Square Holdings Ltd (PSH) and Abrdn Plc for the 2021 and 2022 financial years in the context of business decision-making,
2.	accurately present and communicate the analysis results to proffer appropriate solutions for management decision problems, and
3.	critically evaluate, apply and communicate data analytical solutions for decision making to practical financial and business case applications. 
### Data Sources
The analysis is based on audited financial statements: statement of financial position (balance sheet), statement of comprehensive income (profit and loss statement), statement of cashflow and market data (share values) for year 2021 and 2022 of Pershing Square Holdings Limited and Abrdn Plc respectively. The financial statements were obtained from both FAME [download here](https://fame-r1-bvdinfo-com.plymouth.idm.oclc.org/version-20230918-3-0/fame/1/Companies/Report) and the companies’ websites. The share prices were obtained from Yahoo Finance using the "getSymbols.yahoo" function in R.
